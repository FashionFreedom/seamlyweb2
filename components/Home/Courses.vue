          Our Executive MBAs are 18 month online programmes for mid-level
          managers who want to step up! Professional progression requires
          clarity, vision and the ability to execute consistently on the right
          strategies. Without a roadmap or guidance, the process can be
          overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our EMBAs can help you fast track your growth and save you thousands
          in programme fees. So far our postgraduate courses have helped over
          1000 professionals across 150 countries and territories, and weâ€™d be
          honoured to fast track you too!
